# Hello, my name is [Tom Hudson](https://twitter.com/thetomhudson).

I started programming at a very young age, learning [Atari BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC)
on an [Atari XEGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_XEGS) I then moved into BASIC on an Apple IIe, then onto
Pascal and dBase, all while in middle school and high school.

## Professional Life

Professionally, my experience in programming was fat-client and n-tier architecture, often utilizing Oracle and SQL Server backends, VB, ASP, and some C# for the frontend.

## Personal      

I currently live in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and provide IT & Quality consulting services in the medical device sector. You can learn more about me professionally over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hudsonthomas/).
