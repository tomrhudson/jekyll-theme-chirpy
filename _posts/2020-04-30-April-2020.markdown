- I relocated therefore I upgraded a few items in the [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). Current setup includes...
1. [pfSense XG-7100](https://www.pfsense.org) - for firewall and an intrusion prevention system
2. [UniFi Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-routing-switching/products/udm-pro)
