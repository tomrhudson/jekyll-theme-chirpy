## Highlights
- Accepted into Voyage 23 Chingu Project which starts on 31-August-2020.
- Submitted my [solo project](https://github.com/tomrhudson/soloproject-tier1-favfonts) for the 4-week programming sprint put on my [Chingu](https://chingu.io) and it was accepted!
- Looking into ways to contribute to open source projects. Below are a few ideas that I've complied and a resource that I've come across.
1. [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com)
2. Contribute to projects that I already use (e.g., express, body-parser, ejs, etc.)
3. Contributions can be to documentation, code, etc.
